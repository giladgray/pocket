System = require '../system.coffee'

###*
 * A System that accepts two `requiredComponents` arrays and passes both sets of resolved
 * keys and components to its action function. Also support `PairSystem.forEach` to create a
 * system that calls its action function *for each* pair of matching keys. This can be used
 * to detect collisions or other interactions between keys.
 *
 * @example
 *   pocket.system PairSystem.forEach 'a-b', ['letter'], ['number'],
 *     (pocket, [keyA, letter], [keyB, number]) ->
 *       # function is called for each pair of [letter key, number key]
